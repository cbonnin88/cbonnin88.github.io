<h1> What is Cloud Analytics</h1>
<p>Cloud analytics refers to a type of data analysis that shifts elements of data analytics, such as data processing and storage operations, to a public or private cloud.

<h2>How does Cloud Analytics</h2>

<h3>Types of cloud analytics</h3>
<p>Public cloud analytics, Private Cloud Analytics, Hybrid Cloud Analytics</p>
<h4> Cloud Analytics features and capabilities</h4>
<p>Youâ€™re using cloud analytics if you have at least one or more critical elements of the data analytics process in the cloud. </p>
